**Title: Develop interactive web pages using JavaScript for word counting, product filtering, and mouse-based drawing.**                                                            

*Objective:*
To understand basic DOM manipulation using JavaScript
To create interactive web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
To implement event handling for keyboard and mouse actions
To organize multiple tasks under a single experiment using navigation.                                                                                                           

*Approach:*

I created Experiment–2 consisting of three sub-experiments. A main page is used to navigate between all sub-experiments. Each task is placed in a separate folder and uses individual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

For 2.1 Word Counter, JavaScript is used to count words dynamically as the user types and restrict the input to 150 words.

For 2.2 Product Filter, a dropdown menu is used to filter products based on category. JavaScript is used to show or hide product cards according to the selected option.

For 2.3 Scribble Board, the HTML canvas element is used. Mouse events are handled using JavaScript to allow freehand drawing with the mouse in blue color.
